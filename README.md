repository for evolving the concept of space as scale, instead of as distance

## What is Space ???

The concept of space evolved through millennia of `construction` and `movement`.

To do construction work we measure:

- the `distance` between objects or points
- the `area` of a surface
- the `size`, or `volume`, of an object
- the `height` of an object, point or surface
- lengths and heights involved in pivot devices
- strength of rope based on area of cross-section
- etc

The need to understand physical bodies in `motion`, both celestial and earthly, led to concepts like:

- speed
- acceleration
- force
- pressure
- kinetic and potential energy
- power
  
all require measuring distance/size in varying numbers of dimensions in space.

Newton started with that space as a given, as the absolute medium through which everything exists and happens: `an arena we measure as distance`

Therefore, Classical Physics built its structure of laws and rules around a space which consists of measured, or measurable, distances, through which forces act, and energies are exchanged.

However, that space does `nothing`. It's just there as something `we` measure. It's `inert`. It doesn't **`do`** anything. This explains why forces were introduced to `act` in that space, exerting energy, and effecting change -- i.e. `causation`.

But ...

Across a wide range of phenomena, from super galaxy clusters and planetary nebulae, to plant and animal organ shape and growth patterns, all the way down to DNA molecules and atomic orbitals, there seems to be a kind of thread, or link, between environment and constituent part: the larger engulfing and enfolding the smaller. Each shaping the other beneath and above in the hierarchy. In other words: there is a causal exchange between big and small that is not about the measurement of normal linear distance, but about the `scale` distance between them, i.e. their `relative` size.

The questions I have are about:

- How do the small and the large interact and exchange causation?
- What does such an interaction look like?
- What characteristics does it have?
- How can it be described?
- How do we study this kind of interaction?
- How do we study a hierarchy in Physics?

If our questions are not about motion and construction, but about `growth` and `contraction`, we should not have to contend with that same concept of space -- i.e. that which is measured in linear distance: it would be the wrong abstraction.

If we build a Physics from a space that mediates causation between large and small -- i.e. describes how things at different scales grow, relate and change together:

- what dynamics do we arrive at?
- what would that dynamics be capable of describing?
- what concepts would we find, parallel to speed, acceleration, force, pressure, energy and power?
- what would they mean?
- what other unknowns, in addition to the ones above, would we find?

We can start by drawing that space, and annotating it with what we know:

![alt text][scale-01]

[scale-01]: ./images/scale-02.png "scale and relative distance - base 2 and 10"

<div style="text-align: center; margin: -25px 0px 25px">fig (1) - scale and relative distance</div>


where a unit positive step in Scale corresponds to multiplying the associated dimension (here distance) with the base value (i.e. becoming exponentially larger). A unit step in the negative direction corresponds to dividing the value by the base (i.e. becoming exponentially smaller).

fig (1) shows:

![alt text][scale-02]

[scale-02]: ./images/distance-base-^s.png "scale and relative distance - base 2 and 10"

where `s` is the scale value.

fig (1) doesn't have any measuring unit specified for the distance dimension, since it's invariant for any measuring unit.

The idea here is that any time an observer wants to describe something, they adjust the scale so that what they're describing is at point 0 (size 1) no matter what base is used.

In other words: a description can only be meaningful if it centers the scale around its descriptor, and normalizes its units so that what is being described has a unit size in the associated dimension.

This allows our description to be truly `subjective`, as all descriptions are so, by definition.

This takes the viewpoint that, for any kind of description to be at all possible, to start with at least, we have to choose a scale that normalizes the size of what we're describing to size 1, i.e.: we have to be the same size of what we describe.

At this point we may find Alice's pills to be quite handy: 

```one pill will make you larger, and one will make you small```

.. and here is the kicker:

```and the pill that mother gave you, doesn't do anything at all```

Actually, the pill that mother gave you does do something: it restores you to your `normal` size, since your mother **`knows`** your size.

So, let's recap what this means:

to describe an object, take a pill that makes you its size, and you become, together with what is being described, at point 0 in scale. Take a step to the right, and that multiplies your size by the base you chose for the dimension you chose to describe. A step to the left is the reverse process, you become smaller by the base value.

Now we can derive rates of change, and see what we get.

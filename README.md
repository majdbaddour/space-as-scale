# What is Space ???

The concept of space evolved through millennia of `construction` and `movement`.

To do construction work we measure:

- the `distance` between objects or points
- the `area` of a surface
- the `size`, or `volume`, of an object
- the `height` of an object, point or surface
- lengths and heights involved in pivot devices
- strength of rope based on area of cross-section
- etc

The need to understand physical bodies in `motion`, both celestial and earthly, led to concepts like:

- speed
- acceleration
- force
- pressure
- kinetic and potential energy
- power
  
all require measuring distance/size in varying numbers of dimensions in space.

Newton started with that space as a given, as the absolute medium through which everything exists and happens: an arena we measure as distance. Therefore, Classical Physics built its structure of laws and rules around a space which consists of measured, or measurable, distances, through which forces act, and energies are exchanged.

However, that space does `nothing`. It's just there as something `we` measure. It's `inert`. It doesn't **`do`** anything. This explains why forces were introduced to `act` in that space, exerting energy, and effecting change -- i.e. `causation`.

Across a wide range of phenomena, from super galaxy clusters to DNA molecules, there seems to be a kind of thread, or link, between environment and constituent part. Each shaping the other. In other words: there is a causal exchange between big and small that is not about the measurement of normal linear distance, but about the `scale` distance between them, i.e. their `relative` size.

The questions I have are about:

- How do the small and the large interact and exchange causation?
- What does such an interaction look like?
- What characteristics does it have?
- How can it be described?
- How do we study this kind of interaction?
- How do we study a hierarchy in Physics?

If our questions are not about motion and construction, but about `growth` and `contraction`, we should not have to start with that same concept of space -- i.e. that which is measured in linear distance.

If we build a Physics from a space that mediates/effects causation between large and small:

- what dynamics do we arrive at?
- what would that dynamics be capable of describing?
- what concepts would we find, parallel to speed, acceleration, force, pressure, energy and power?
- what would they mean?
- what other unknown would we find?

We can start by drawing that space, and annotating it with what we know:
